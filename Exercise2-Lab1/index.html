            <hr> I taught my final course in Fall 2019. You can view a <a

            computer science.
            <hr> Khan Academy now carries <a

                If you are, then see the <a href="#solutions">frequently asked question and answer</a> below.
            <p>
                If you request solutions from me, I will not respond.
